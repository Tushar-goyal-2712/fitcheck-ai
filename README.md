# Fitcheck AI

Fitcheck AI is a Django-based application that uses a YOLOv8 deep learning model for real-time image analysis. The project involves training a YOLOv8 model on a dataset of 13,500 images for training and 3,000 images for validation/testing, followed by the deployment of a Django application where users can upload or capture images using a laptop camera for real-time analysis.
